A brief description of what this project does and who it's for
Virtual Internship - Networking Fundamentals and Topology Design

Developed Network Topologies: Created and configured network topologies using Cisco Packet Tracer, selecting and completing one of three complex network setups to establish effective connectivity between multiple computers.
Packet Tracing and Analysis: Utilized the built-in Packet Sniffer tool in Packet Tracer to intercept, analyze, and extract packet header data, gaining hands-on experience with Ethernet and IP protocols.
Routing and Switching Operations: Configured OSPF dynamic routing protocol and conducted detailed analysis of MAC, ARP, and routing tables to explore traffic management, packet forwarding, and address resolution across networks.
Connectivity Testing and Troubleshooting: Executed "ping" tests to verify connectivity between devices and experimented with switch configurations to understand fundamental operations such as learning, flooding, and forwarding.
Documentation and Submission: Submitted .pkt file simulations with flow diagrams detailing packet flow paths from host to external networks, demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of inter-network communication.
